# Playwright API Tests for Azure Speech Endpoints

- Tests cover all endpoints:

  - `/get-speech-token`
  - `/get-ice-server-token`
  - `/get-oai-response`

- To run:

  ```sh
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- Ensure your Next.js dev server is running on the default port (http://localhost:3000) for tests to pass.
